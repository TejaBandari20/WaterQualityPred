### ðŸ’§ **Project Title:**

**Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning**

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Project Description:**

This project focuses on predicting the **quality of water** using various physicochemical properties (e.g., pH, conductivity, turbidity, etc.) and applying **machine learning techniques** to classify or predict whether the water is safe or not.

---

### ðŸ§¾ **Key Steps Involved:**

1. **Data Collection:**

   * Dataset includes water quality parameters like pH, conductivity, oxygen level, etc.
   * Uploaded CSV file (`afa2e701598d20110228.csv`) contains the raw data.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**

   * Handling missing values, encoding categorical data if needed.
   * Removing duplicates, scaling numerical data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   * Statistical summary of each feature.
   * Correlation heatmap and visualization to understand patterns.

4. **Model Building:**

   * ML algorithms like **Random Forest**, **Decision Tree**, or **Logistic Regression**.
   * Splitting data into training and testing sets.
   * Evaluating using metrics like **accuracy**, **MSE**, or **classification report**.

5. **Prediction & Output:**

   * Predicts the water quality level or index.
   * Can be used to classify water as **safe/unsafe** or assign a quality grade.
